        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>

      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s), textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor, congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p><correction>
          <p>This text may include corrections made after the original edition went to press in order to correct errors and improve glosses. For a full list of editorial and typographical corrections made to this edition, please view its correction log on Github: https://github.com/mets-editions/coletti-digbymagdalene/blob/main/coletti-digbymagdalene-export-corrections-log.docx</p>

 <note type="enote" n="1">1<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">forfetur</hi>. <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">forfeture</hi> (n.), sense 2c. In phrases with “in,” the phrase means “on pain of losing, under penalty of losing.”</note>
 <note type="enote" n="2">9<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Tyberyus Sesar</hi>. Roman emperor (42 BCE–37 CE) during the life and ministry of Jesus. No other ME life of Mary Magdalene depicts Caesar as ruler. Velz (“Sovereignty in the Digby”) argues that the appearance of Tiberius and his political functionaries Herod and Pilate establishes the play’s focus on forms of sovereignty and subjection, just and unjust rule. Mitchell-Buck (“Tyrants, Tudors”) notes an abundance of tyrants in the play.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="3">20<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Serybyl</hi> (speech heading). This unusual name appears to denote an official function. BMH (pp. 197–98) suggest possible echoes of the Sibyl and the similarity of Serybyl to the “skrybe” addressed in line 114. Serybyl is called “Syrybbe” at line 33.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="4">21<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Belyall</hi>. A biblical term, deriving from 2 Corinthians 6:15 and 3 Kings 21:10, and indicating the personification of evil, often used as a synonym of Satan.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="5">24<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">provost</hi>. <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">provost</hi> (n.), sense a: “the representative of a king or emperor in a country or district; governor, administrator.”</note>
 <note type="enote" n="6">44, s.d.<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">all</hi><hi rend="italic"> the pepul</hi>. This is the first of several scenes in the play indicating the presence of a group, implying even a small crowd, of non-speaking characters.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="7">46<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">wyn and</hi><hi rend="italic"> spycys</hi>. Wine sweetened and seasoned with spices was a regular feature of meals prepared for aristocrats and other prosperous medieval people. For recipes and commentary, see Freedman, <hi rend="italic">Out of the</hi><hi rend="italic"> East</hi>, pp. 22–23. Dugan (<hi rend="italic">Ephemeral History of Perfume</hi>, p. 37) notes that the play’s “many calls for ‘wine and spices’ mimic structures of trade symbolism . . . [and provide] stage properties culled from medieval markets.”</note>
 <note type="enote" n="8">49<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Syrus</hi> (speech heading). Medieval versions of Mary Magdalene’s legendary life created a domestic backstory for her reputed career as a sinner by giving her a nuclear family. The Digby play amplifies her father Syrus’ brief role in that story. The <hi rend="italic">Legenda Aurea</hi>, Jacobus de Voragine’s thirteenth-century collection of saints’ lives, provided the best known and most influential version of Mary Magdalene’s legendary acts and wanderings (<hi rend="italic">GL</hi>, pp. 117–44). Textual commentary on the play in BMH include detailed extracts from Jacobus’ vita, thereby enabling comparison with the Digby play’s representation of these non-biblical elements.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="9">51<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">bower</hi>. <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">bour</hi> (n.), sense 1a: “a dwelling, house, mansion, cottage.”</note>
 <note type="enote" n="10">55<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">be cleffys </hi><hi rend="italic">so cold</hi>. BMH (p. 198) note the playwright’s use here of a common verse tag, citing an analogy in the <hi rend="italic">Croxton Play of the Sacrament</hi>, “be the clyffys cold” (line 100).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="11">71<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">ful of femynyté</hi>. Cyrus is the first to speak this important word in the play (see lines 423, 516, 943, 1356). T. Williams (<hi rend="italic">Inventing Womanhood</hi>, pp. 149, 4) argues that “femininity” emerges as a new gendered term in late medieval English writing, calling attention to the “evolution of gendered language” in a period when “what it meant to be a woman . . . was very much an open question.” Dixon (“‘Thys Body of Mary’”) discusses the bodily dimensions of femininity in the play and in late medieval women’s spirituality.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="12">73<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">merrorys</hi>. <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">mirour</hi> (n.), sense 3a: “a model of good or virtuous conduct.”</note>
 <note type="enote" n="13">71–74<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Here is Mary . . . hart with consolacyon</hi>. C (p. 5) notes that Cyrus’ courtly language here anticipates the idiom employed by the King of Flesh (line 423) and the king of Marseilles (lines 942–49), as well as the entire verbal performance of Mary Magdalene’s tempter, Curiosity. Such language also affirms the “jentyll” status claimed by Cyrus and his family (lines 105, 112–13). Cyrus’ introduction of his children (see also lines 66–70) resembles the account of their many physical and social gifts in the thirteenth-century life of the saint sometimes attributed to Rabanus Maurus. See <hi rend="italic">Life of Saint</hi><hi rend="italic"> Mary Magdalene</hi>, ed. Mycoff, p. 29.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="14">81<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">thys castell</hi>. When Cyrus identifies his bequest to daughter Mary Magdalene as thys castell, he both draws upon Jacobus de Voragine’s idea that she derived her identity from the castle Magdalo, as Caxton’s translation puts it (<hi rend="italic">GL</hi>, p. 118), and situates his family within the social and economic matrix of the feudal world. See <hi rend="italic">PDD</hi>, pp. 347–49. At the same time, medieval literary castles are potent and multivalent symbols, pointing to spiritual and material allegorical meanings. For example, as Riggio has shown (“Allegory of Feudal Acquisition”), in the East Anglian morality play <hi rend="italic">Castle of Perseverance</hi>, the trope of the individual Christian soul’s protective spiritual enclosure spills out onto the economic realities and pressures of feudal society. Mary Magdalene’s castle merits attention in light of the proliferation of allegorical castles in medieval English and continental literature. See Cornelius, “Figurative Castle.”</note>
 <note type="enote" n="15">83–84<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Thes gyftes . . . in good</hi><hi rend="italic"> mynd</hi>. Cyrus repeats the idiom of late medieval testators who similarly pledged that their bequests were made under such conditions: John Baret (1463), “I, John Baret . . . of good mynde and memorye”; and John Wastell (1515), “I, John Wastell . . . beyng of good and hool mynde.” See Tymms, <hi rend="italic">Wills and Inventories</hi>, pp. 15, 113.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="16">87–88<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Ye have grauntyd swych a lyfelod . . . from</hi><hi rend="italic"> all nessesyté</hi>. <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">lif-lod(e</hi> (n.), sense 2a; <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">necessité</hi> (n.), sense b. Lazarus invokes key terms from late medieval discourses on poverty and charity; Mary Magdalene explicitly refers to the “peynes of poverté” from which their father’s gift frees her and her siblings (line 96). These terms signal the play’s engagement with the relationship of economic discourses and social practices to construction of spiritual identities by the dominant classes in late medieval England. See <hi rend="italic">PDD</hi>, pp. 347–49.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="17">93–94<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Thatt God . . . hony be kynd</hi>. Mary Magdalene’s reference to the “sweet” name of God anticipates the preoccupation with the name of Jesus expressed later in the play; see lines 760, 1446, 1468, 1555–61, 2031–32, 2124. From the thirteenth century, the Name of Jesus was the subject of a devotional cult that attracted monastic and lay participants. The Holy Name was honored in the Jesus mass and eventually in the new liturgical Feast of the Name of Jesus. The cult of the Holy Name was particularly popular in England. Declared official by the province of York in 1489, the Feast of the Holy Name appears frequently in liturgical service books of the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, the period in which the Digby <hi rend="italic">Magdalene</hi> was composed and copied in its single manuscript. See Pfaff, <hi rend="italic">New Liturgical Feasts</hi>, pp. 62–83, and Renevey, “Name above Names.” F (p. 58) suggests that Mary’s reference to sweetness “introduces the first of many allusions in the play to the <hi rend="italic">Song of</hi><hi rend="italic"> Songs</hi>.”</note>
 <note type="enote" n="18">97<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">streytnes</hi>. <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">streitnes(se</hi> (n.), sense 6a: “trouble, difficulty . . . hardship (esp. financial hardship), straitened circumstances; a state of impoverishment.”</note>
 <note type="enote" n="19">106<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">So mekly</hi>. <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">mek</hi> (adj.), sense 1b: “full of loving kindness, benevolent, kind, sweet”; and <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">meke</hi> (adv.): “humbly, submissively.”</note>
 <note type="enote" n="20">107–09<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Hey in heven . . . shal hens passe</hi>. Mary Magdalene and her siblings appear to be proto-Christians, all making reference to a singular God in this scene.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="21">110<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">mygthtys</hi>. <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">might</hi> (n.), sense 3a: “ability, capability, capacity.”</note>
 <note type="enote" n="22">111<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">enhanse</hi>. <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">enhauncen</hi> (v.), sense 5: “to elevate or advance (someone to a high rank or station).”</note>
 <note type="enote" n="23">112<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">wyn and spycys</hi>. Cyrus’ call for wine and spices caps a scene in which he and his children declare their interest in the comfort afforded by material assets. On land-grabbing and conspicuous consumption by East Anglian gentry whom the play seems implicitly to address, see <hi rend="italic">PDD</hi>, pp. 347–49. As Coletti notes (“Design of the Digby Play”), this is the first of many scenes associating Mary Magdalene with corporeal, heavenly, and sacramental food. See also <ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal">note to line 46</ref> above.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="24">117<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Herowdys</hi>. Among the several generations of the Herodian dynasty, scripture and traditions of biblical commentary attend to three important rulers: Herod the Great (of Ascalon), his son Herod Antipas, and his grandson, Herod Agrippa. Writers of medieval English biblical drama follow traditions associated with Herod the Great, appointed by the Romans as King of the Jews in 37–34 BCE; but the sources they used sometimes conflated elements of the lives of these different Herods. For example, the Herod who was contemporary with the adult Jesus — and would be the historically accurate figure in the Digby play’s scriptural narrative — was Herod Antipas. Nonetheless, the play gives him attributes that other English biblical dramas ascribed to Herod the Great, who was responsible for the Massacre of the Innocents (Matthew 2:13–18). See Coletti (“Story of Herod”) for discussion of and extensive bibliography on this figure in medieval drama.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="25">118<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Pylat</hi>. Luke’s gospel (3:1) names Pilate as governor of Judea in the reign of Tiberius Caesar. See <ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal">note to lines 1255–56</ref> below.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="26">120<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">my precept</hi><hi rend="italic"> wretyn be</hi>. On the importance of writing and its attestation to complex influences of late medieval documentary culture, see Lim, “Pilate’s Special Letter.”</note>
 <note type="enote" n="27">121<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">owit wrech</hi>. Literally, “to owe (or incur) harm.” <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">ouen</hi> (v.), sense 2; and <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">wrech(e</hi> (n.), sense 2. See also the <ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal">textual note on this line</ref>.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="28">127<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">harlettys</hi>. <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">harlot</hi> (n.), sense 1b: “as term of abuse: scoundrel, knave, rogue, reprobate, base fellow, coward.”</note>
 <note type="enote" n="29">120–28<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Take hed . . . make with malynacyon</hi>. The syntax of the emperor’s speech is convoluted and unclear: he commands Herod and Pilate either to do harm to any people in their respective realms who speak against Caesar himself and his laws and gods; or he warns them that such will be the fate of those persons. The reference at line 126 to the regent who holds “his croun” from Caesar by right pertains only to Herod.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="30">133<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">So bere thes lettyrs</hi>. Scherb (<hi rend="italic">Staging Faith</hi>, p. 179) highlights the secular and spiritual importance of letters in the play. See also Lim, “Pilate’s Special Letter.” Northway (“It’s All in the Delivery”) discusses the relationship of letter-bearing to documentary practices and political culture in the early modern period, but with interesting implications for the Digby <hi rend="italic">Magdalene</hi>.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="31">136<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Nuncyus</hi> (speech heading). Scherb (<hi rend="italic">Staging Faith</hi>, pp. 172–73) notes the prevalence of messengers in large-scale East Anglian plays such as the Digby <hi rend="italic">Magdalene</hi>, where they serve to link the occupants of various scaffolds. Messengers are also prominent in the <hi rend="italic">Castle of Perseverance</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">N-Town</hi><hi rend="italic"> Plays</hi>.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="32">140<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">In the wyld, wanyng world</hi>. <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">waning(e</hi> (ger.), sense 3c notes that this phrase “in a direct address” means “a curse upon you.”</note>
 <note type="enote" n="33">143<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Mahond</hi>. Medieval English drama is replete with characters who profess devotion to Mohammed (Mahond, Mahowne, Mahowdys, etc.), the prophet of Islam whom they erroneously take for a god. Although dramatic invocations of Mohammed function differently from play to play, they generally denote a false god whose worship is contrasted to devotion to Christianity’s true God. Appeals to Mahond/Mahowne in biblical plays are always anachronistic, since the prophet of Islam was not born until the sixth century. The Digby Herod is not the only Jew in English biblical drama to pledge loyalty to Mahond; e.g., the Towneley manuscript’s “Herod” play associates its main character with Mahowne (<hi rend="italic">Towneley</hi>, 1:183–204); and the Jews of the <hi rend="italic">Croxton Play of the Sacrament</hi> also invoke Machomet (see lines 149, 209, 332, 453). The Digby Herod’s swearing by “Mahondys bonys” (line 142) echoes Christian oaths that anatomized the body of Christ, a practice that Chaucer’s Pardoner excoriates (<hi rend="italic">CT</hi> VI[C] 629–60), and demonstrates the tendency, in ME dramatic texts, for worship of Mahond to mimic that of the Christian god. See Chemers, “Anti-Semitism” and Leshock, “Representation of Islam.”</note>
 <note type="enote" n="34">156<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">in dowt</hi>. <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">dout(e</hi> (n.), sense 4: “a cause or reason for fear; something to be feared; danger, peril.”</note>

Herod’s consultation with philosophers who interpret biblical prophecy in the play (lines 175–76, 184–85) is reminiscent of his conversations with the Magi and other wisdom figures in the Magi and Innocents plays of the English biblical cycle plays.

 <note type="enote" n="43">202<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">grettly rejoysyth to my sprytes indede</hi>. In a typical twisting of grammar and syntax, the playwright (or scribe) adds the gratuitous preposition “to,” which must take as its object “sprytes,” the word that also acts as direct object of the verb “rejoysyth.” The sense of lines 202–03 thus seems to be: “This [the soldier’s announcement] is to me a gracious exhortation, one that brings great joy to my spirits.”</note>
 <note type="enote" n="44">204<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">I woll suffer non to spryng of </hi><hi rend="italic">that kenred</hi>. Herod declares his interest in halting the production of lineage by the genealogy (“kenred,” or kindred) whose triumph is asserted in biblical prophecies. Plays on the Massacre of the Innocents in medieval English biblical drama represent this subject with imagination and creativity. Foundational to Herod’s wrathful anxiety in these plays is the medieval account of his own tortured genealogical and familial crimes. In this account, Herod is motivated by political ambitions that sought to disavow his low birth as well as the derivative nature of power held not in his own right but by Roman sanction. Based on Josephus’ <hi rend="italic">Jewish War</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Jewish Antiquities</hi> and developed by Eusebius’ <hi rend="italic">Historia Ecclesiastica</hi>, the medieval English story of Herod took shape in Peter Comestor’s <hi rend="italic">Historia Scholastica</hi>, Ranulph Higden’s <hi rend="italic">Polychronicon</hi>, and their translation and redaction in many historical and homiletic works. See Coletti, “Story of Herod,” pp. 40–47; and “Saint Anne Dedication,” pp. 34–36. In the <hi rend="italic">Killing of the </hi><hi rend="italic">Children</hi> (BMH, p. 101, lines 125–26), a play on the Massacre preserved in the same manuscript as <hi rend="italic">Mary Magdalene</hi>, for example, Herod’s dynastic ambitions are reinforced by a soldier who erroneously declares: “we hold you for chef regent, / By titelle of enheritaunce, as your auncetours beforn.”</note>

The appearance of this evil cohort, presumably on separate scaffolds, marks the play’s shift from the biblical historical world to an allegorical one. No other ME life of Mary Magdalene makes her the victim of colluding immoral forces. The World, the Flesh, the Devil, and the Seven Deadly Sins are not only frequent subjects but also organizing principles of anonymous medieval homiletic and catechetical writing and works by well known ME writers; e.g., among their many literary identities, Chaucer’s Parson’s Tale and Gower’s <hi rend="italic">Confessio Amantis</hi> are both penitential works structured by appeals to the Seven Deadly Sins. The Digby <hi rend="italic">Magdalene</hi>’s cohort of tempters also appear together, though differently grouped, in the East Anglian <hi rend="italic">Castle of Perseverance</hi>. BMH (pp. 200–01) compare the two plays’ arrangement of these evil alliances.</note>

 <note type="enote" n="61">312<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">whele of fortune</hi>. World’s alliance with the wheel of fortune is hardly surprising. The concept of Fortune and her wheel figures ubiquitously in medieval reflections on the instability of human circumstances and fates, i.e. human existence in the material world.

Flesh’s “deyntys delycyows” constitute a virtual catalog of the most popular medieval spices, including galingale, long pepper, and grains of paradise; their representation here introduces the aromatic balms that will become the penitent Magdalene’s iconic emblem. As Freedman (<hi rend="italic">Out of the East</hi>, pp. 1–75) notes, these and other spices attained widespread use in medieval cookery, but they were also understood to have medicinal properties, as were certain gemstones (Flesh also possesses “margaretton” or pearls in line 339). Dugan (<hi rend="italic">Ephemeral History of Perfume</hi>, pp. 38–41) traces the unfolding of the olfactory sense in the play, noting its power to trespass bodily and other boundaries. BMH (p. 201) note that similar catalogs appear in <hi rend="italic">The Croxton Play of</hi><hi rend="italic"> the Sacrament</hi> (lines 173–88) and John Heywood’s <hi rend="italic">Play Called</hi><hi rend="italic"> the Four PP</hi> (lines 604–43).

The ubiquitous presence of spices in medieval food preparation and medicine suggests that Flesh’s “comfortatywys” would likely be familiar to the dramatic audience.

Here the Devil explains his reasoning for instigating the fall of humankind and his continuing interest in tempting humanity, now represented by the vulnerable Mary Magdalene: he is jealous of the joy that Lucifer lost when he fell from heaven to hell, a joy that humanity somehow proleptically still experiences, even though Christ’s death, and the redemption that accompanies it, have yet to occur in the world of the play. Nomenclature in this passage is confusing. The speaker self-identifies as Satan (line 359); whereas some accounts make Satan the fallen angel Lucifer, here Satan speaks as if Lucifer is a different being (lines 366–67).</note>

DiSalvo (“Unexpected Saints,” pp. 70–75) states that the play’s inclusion of “supernatural elements associated with . . . devils” enables the protagonist “to be” a “saint” (p. 70). DiSalvo compares the devils of <hi rend="italic">Mary Magdalene</hi> with those of its companion play in Bodleian MS Digby 133, <hi rend="italic">The Conversion of St. Paul</hi>.

 <note type="enote" n="79">377<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Wyth wrath </hi><hi rend="italic">or wyhyllys we shal hyrre wynne</hi>. A potentially confusing shift of pronouns occurs suddenly here. In the preceding speech Satan has spoken of his desire to besiege the human soul; accordingly he uses specifically masculine or gender-neutral plural pronouns (“he” in lines 366, 370; “hym” in line 372; “hem” in lines 366, 369, 370). The use of feminine singular pronouns by Wrath and Envy (“hyrre” in line 377; “hur” in line 378) signals an abrupt shift of focus to Mary Magdalene. See also BMH (p. 202) on variant readings of this line.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="80">383<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">afyauns</hi>.

 <note type="enote" n="81">384<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">A</hi><hi rend="italic"> woman of whorshep ower servant to make</hi>. Satan employs the feudal language of service to signify the relationship of the World, the Flesh, and the Devil to their minions. For example, Satan commands “knythtys” (line 373) and is the head of a “howshold” (line 403). Lechery tempts Mary Magdalene by offering her “servyse” and “atendauns” (line 424). See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">servaunt</hi> (n.), sense 1a; service (n.), sense 3c; and worship(e (n.), sense 3b.

 <note type="enote" n="87">420<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">She shal byn </hi><hi rend="italic">abyll to dystroye helle</hi>. Mundus’ extraordinary claim about the unfallen Magdalene seems to conflate her powers with those of the Virgin Mary; as such, his is the first of many allusions aligning the play’s heroine with the mother of Jesus. In fearing that Mary Magdalene may be able to “destroy hell,” Mundus invokes scriptural commentary that identified the Virgin Mary as the woman of Genesis 3:14–15 who will “crush” the serpent’s head. Hence Mundus’ statement seems to associate the defeat of the serpent (Genesis 3:14–15 reports God’s warning to the successful tempter of Adam and Eve) with a more general destruction of hell, the serpent (Lucifer/Satan’s) home. Spector (<hi rend="italic">NT</hi>, 2:421n2/259–66; 434n7/51–2) cites allusions to this attribute of the Virgin Mary in the N-Town plays of the “Fall of Man” (1:32, lines 259–66) and “Jesse Root,” or the Prophets’ Play (1:67, lines 49–56), noting that this symbolic understanding of Marian power also appears in the Anglo-Norman <hi rend="italic">Jeu d’Adam</hi> and Philippe de Mézières’ play on the Presentation of Mary in the Temple.

Williams (<hi rend="italic">French Fetish</hi>, pp. 114–17) notes how quickly Mary Magdalene picks up Lechery’s seductive language, an idiom, coded as French and feminine, that “removes Mary from the humdrum quotidian, and places her . . . within the rarified world of French romance” (p. 115). Williams suggests that Lechery, even though she is “Lady Lechery,” is intent on seducing Mary Magdalene, thereby creating opportunities for homoerotic play that would only be compounded if both parts were played by boys or young men. Lechery’s language becomes more obscure and convoluted as the scene unfolds, e.g., lines 456–59.</note>

 <note type="enote" n="102">470<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">I am a taverner</hi>. The scene of Mary Magdalene’s seduction in the tavern is one of the playwright’s major additions to her traditional <hi rend="italic">vita</hi>. Taverns appear frequently in medieval comic and homiletic writing, where they figure as sites of both amusement and sin. Scherb (<hi rend="italic">Staging Faith</hi>, pp. 175–76) highlights the pleasures and dangers of some medieval literary taverns. As Coletti observes, the Digby play’s tavern is also implicated in, and evokes the values of, commercial exchange in the medieval mercantile economy. Mary Magdalene’s tavern repartee, first with Luxuria and then Curiosity, is inflected by status-consciousness; see C, pp. 6–7, and sources cited therein. According to Strohm (“Three London Itineraries,” p. 10), the medieval urban tavern was “a place where reconsideration . . . of social status might occur.” In the Dutch play <hi rend="italic">Mary of Nemmegen</hi>, another unruly girl meets trouble in a tavern similarly situated at the intersection of economics and morality. See Sponsler, <hi rend="italic">Drama and</hi><hi rend="italic"> Resistance</hi>, pp. 95–102. Streitman (“Face of Janus”) discusses resemblances between the Digby saint play and the Dutch play.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="103">474–80<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Of</hi><hi rend="italic"> wynys . . . ye can goo</hi>. The international wine list of which the taverner boasts gives a worldly wise dimension to the site of Mary Magdalene’s assignation, especially from a commercial perspective. BMH (p. 203) gloss the taverner’s wine list primarily in terms of country of origin; however, “clary wynne,” “claret,” and “vernage” signify types of wine or medicinal drinks. See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">clare</hi> (n.1); <hi rend="italic">claret</hi> (n.1); <hi rend="italic">vernage</hi> (n.).

 <note type="enote" n="105">486<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">good restoratyff</hi>. The taverner’s recommendation of his wine as an effective cordial that provides relief from “stodyys and hevynes” (line 488) elides the wine’s intoxicating functions with quasi-medicinal purposes.</note>

 <note type="enote" n="107">491<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Hof</hi><hi rend="italic">, hof, hof! A frysch new galaunt</hi>. By the mid-fifteenth century, the gallant was recognized as a satiric and socioeconomic type, especially by moralists and homilists who condemned the gallant’s material excess, sartorial extravagance, and aspirations to high social status. The Digby play’s gallant thus aligns Mary Magdalene’s seduction with a well-developed discourse of social critique. See Davenport, “‘Lusty Fresche Galaunts’” and C, pp. 7–12, and sources cited therein. According to Davenport (p. 114), “<hi rend="italic">hoff</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">hof</hi> or <hi rend="italic">huffa</hi>)” is a signature of the gallant’s speech. The gallant makes frequent appearances in medieval East Anglian drama. In Satan’s prologue to N-Town’s “Conspiracy” play and <hi rend="italic">Wisdom</hi>, Lucifer dons the guise of the gallant. The eponymous protagonist of the Macro <hi rend="italic">Mankind</hi> is lured into sin by a trio of gallants: Nought, New Guise, and Nowadays. Superbia, or Pride, in the <hi rend="italic">Castle of Perseverance</hi> sports a gallant’s attire. Cox (<hi rend="italic">The Devil and the </hi><hi rend="italic">Sacred</hi>, pp. 64–65) claims that the Digby play’s Curiosity, like the gallants in the N-Town “Conspiracy” and the <hi rend="italic">Castle of Perseverance</hi>, is aristocratic; in support, he cites Curiosity’s affiliations with the “sevyn prynsys of hell” (line 324) and Satan’s rousing of his “knythtys” (line 373). The social affiliations of the evil characters, according to Cox, mirror Mary Magdalene’s identification as an aristocrat.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="108">493–94<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Wene ye . . . </hi><hi rend="italic">com to town</hi>. The gallant’s anxiety about a mercantile identity picks up on the taverner’s commercial concerns. D.

The Digby play gallant’s inventory of his clothing is among the most detailed in medieval English drama. As C (pp. 9–10) observes, the gallant’s investment in attire encodes anxieties about social status that late medieval sumptuary laws and didactic discourses about clothing sought to regulate. N. Smith’s <hi rend="italic">Sartorial</hi><hi rend="italic"> Strategies</hi> analyzes the relationship between the gallant’s exhibitionism, sartorial display, and the performance of sin, as well as the figurative possibilities of aristocratic attire.

 <note type="enote" n="114">506<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">I do it for no pryde</hi>. The gallant’s protestation is an ironic double-entendre; the Bad Angel who soon rejoices in Mary’s seduction identifies her tempter as “Pryde, callyd Coriosté” (line 550).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="115">511<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Coryossyté</hi>. The gallant is given a name. The term curiosity bears a lot of semantic weight. See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">curiousité</hi> (n.); all senses elaborated in the <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>’s definitions seem to apply here. Zacher (<hi rend="italic">Curiosity and Pilgrimage</hi>, p. 31) states that medieval curiositas was frequently associated with pride. The thirteenth-century play known as <hi rend="italic">Courtois d’ Arras</hi> bears interesting similarities to the dramatic scenario and characterization of the much later Digby <hi rend="italic">Magdalene</hi>, though the late medieval English play splits between the gallant Curiosity and Mary Magdalene the attributes of the French dramatic protagonist.

 <note type="enote" n="116">515<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">daysyys iee</hi>. <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">daies-ie</hi> (n.). Curiosity invokes the European daisy or marguerite. A common native flower, the daisy also carries complex meanings.

 <note type="enote" n="118">515–19<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">A, dere dewchesse . . . peynnes</hi><hi rend="italic"> of perplexité</hi>. Curiosity’s come-on to the emotionally vulnerable Mary Magdalene and his contributions to their ensuing dialogue echo the convoluted, aureate idiom and rhetorical situation of the late ME poem known as “The Craft of Lovers,” as do Lechery’s wooing of Mary Magdalene (lines 440–59) and the dialogue that introduces the king and queen of Marseilles (lines 942–60). “The Craft of Lovers” stages a conversation between a lover and a lady initially identified as a “curyous” argument (ed. Kooper, line 2); wildly metaphoric, its evocation of courtship calls attention to the manner and terms of courtly language (e.g., lines 78–79). The three extant manuscript versions of the poem are associated with John Shirley; John Stow included “The Craft of Lovers” in his 1561 edition of Chaucer’s <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>. See Kooper, “Slack Water Poetry.” F (p. 64) notes the poem’s relevance to the play.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="119">520<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">wene ye that I were a kelle</hi>. Without citing a source, BMH (p. 251) define “kelle” as “a fishnet or a woman’s cap,” which they extrapolate to mean “prostitute” or “loose woman.” AND variously defines <hi rend="italic">kalle</hi> (n.) (also <hi rend="italic">kele</hi> and <hi rend="italic">kelle</hi>) as “net”; “hair-net”; “head-gear.” To gloss this line Karras (“Holy Harlots,” p. 23n69) cites <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">kelis</hi> (n. pl.): “ill-bred” or “low-class people.” Mary Magdalene, then, seems to respond to Curiosity’s sudden come-on, by asking “What do you think I am, a loose woman?”</note>

 <note type="enote" n="122">527<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Syr, curtesy doth it yow lere</hi>. To Curiosity’s declaration that he cannot restrain himself, Mary Magdalene retorts, “Courtesy should teach you how to do that”; or “You should know better.” Her invocation of courtesy here, as C (pp. 12–16) argues, points to the larger drama of social identities that the playwright weaves into the saint’s <hi rend="italic">vita</hi>.</note>

 <note type="enote" n="124">530<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">wol yow dawns</hi>. F (p. 74) places Mary Magdalene’s dance in a complex set of imaginative and epistolary intertexts. The gallant’s invitation implicitly signals the presence of instrumental music in this scene. Brokaw (<hi rend="italic">Staging Harmony</hi>, pp. 12–49) considers how the play uses music to express “temptation, sin, and the entrapments of fleshly pleasures” (p. 17); she stresses the importance of musical sound in the sensory reception of medieval drama. Brokaw also compares the Digby <hi rend="italic">Magdalene</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Wisdom</hi> as examples of East Anglian drama that stage complex religious confessions through their musical appeals; as these notes indicate, the two plays bear other similarities to each other. On Mary Magdalene as a dancer, see Davidson, “Middle English Saint Play,” p. 83. Loewen (“Conversion of Mary Magdalene”) analyzes the German Passion Plays’ extensive use of music to dramatize Mary Magdalene’s conversion from sin to pious living. In these plays, musical performance integrates the homiletic rhetoric of Franciscan preachers and the spiritual possibilities expressed in musical notation. For a general discussion of musical performance in the play, see Rastall, <hi rend="italic">Heaven Singing</hi>, pp. 173–74.</note>

 <note type="enote" n="128">543–46<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Evyn at your </hi><hi rend="italic">wyl . . . for your sake</hi>. C (pp. 1–4) notes the congruence of Mary Magdalene’s moral demise with negative examples of medieval English conduct literature. Still, compared to English Reformation portrayals of Mary Magdalene’s transgressions and those in continental medieval dramas, the Digby play’s portrait of Mary Magdalene’s sinful behaviors in this scene and at lines 564–71 is relatively tame. For continental examples, see Loewen, “Conversion of Mary Magdalene.” Badir (<hi rend="italic">Maudlin Impression</hi>, pp. 32–40) and Atkin (<hi rend="italic">Drama of</hi><hi rend="italic"> Reform</hi>, pp. 109–14) discuss the sexually explicit, salacious exchange between Mary and her tempters in Wager’s <hi rend="italic">Life and Repentaunce</hi><hi rend="italic"> of Mary Magdalene</hi>; see White, <hi rend="italic">Reformation Biblical Drama</hi> (pp. 16–28).

(See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">grom</hi> (n.), sense 3a.) BMH suggest the dramatist “may well have been employing a traditional alliterative phrase with no clear idea of its sense.”</note>
 <note type="enote" n="130">550<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Pryde, callyd Coriosté</hi>. The gallant’s lavish clothing and smooth rhetoric also enable his disguise in <hi rend="italic">Wisdom</hi> (<hi rend="italic">MP</hi>, p. 125), where Lucifer masquerades as a gallant.</note>

 <note type="enote" n="132">559<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">of hure al helle shall make rejoysseyng</hi>. Allegorical tempters never explain why Mary Magdalene is considered such a welcome target by those who want to bring her down. Their approach to her, through courtliness and flattery of her social status, resonates in their celebration of her downfall: she is paradoxically a “soveryn,” or mighty, elevated, “servant” (line 556) who “hath hure fet in synne.”</note>

F (pp. 76–78) aligns Mary Magdalene’s plea on behalf of her putative lovers with the medieval Valentine poetry of courtly writers such as Geoffrey Chaucer, John Clanvowe, John Gower, John Lydgate, Oton de Granson, and Charles d’Orléans.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="135">565<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">byrd</hi>. <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">birde</hi> (n.1). The <hi rend="italic">MED</hi> cites very contrary meanings: a “bird” (sense 1) is most often “a woman of noble birth, a damsel,” a fair lady, etc. But the word (sense 3a) can also denote “a man of noble birth, scion, lord.” The latter would seem to be what Mary Magdalene intends here; alternatively, she may be punning on ME <hi rend="italic">brid</hi> (sense 1a), that is, the avian creatures whom Chaucer in <hi rend="italic">The Parliament of Foules</hi> also associates with the “valentines” whose arrival Mary awaits in her arbor. F (pp. 76–77) discusses the connection between birds and lovers in medieval Valentine poetry.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="136">566<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">bote</hi>. <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">bote</hi> (n.1), sense 1a: “advantage, help, profit, good, benefit.”</note>

Mary Magdalene’s arbor taps the <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>’s multiple meanings for this word; it is a “pleasure garden” (sense a); an “herb garden” (sense b); a “bower covered with flowers, vines, [and] shrubs” (sense e). F (pp. 98–100) surveys these multiple possibilities. For example, Mary’s arbor calls to mind both the medieval Garden of Love, frequently depicted in illustrated manuscripts of the <hi rend="italic">Roman de </hi><hi rend="italic">la Rose</hi>, and the Garden of Eden. The sensuous language of the female speaker in the garden also evokes the <hi rend="italic">hortus conclusus</hi>, or enclosed garden of the Song of Songs, unleashing potential for her identification with the Song’s Bride. Scherb (<hi rend="italic">Staging Faith</hi>, p. 177) finds religious valences in Mary’s speech, including echoes of biblical imagery of the garden in Song of Songs 4:5–6; Ecclesiastes 24:42, and Isaias 58:11.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="138">564–71<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">A God be . . . halse and kysse</hi>. This final image of Mary Magdalene before she responds to the Good Angel’s imprecations depicts her as a romance heroine, longing and waiting for her lover. F (pp. 75–79) notes the scene’s important intersection with the imagery and idiom of secular love poetry. Occurring in none of the sources for the play, this scene provides the play’s “only glimpse . . . of Mary’s sensual life” (F, p. 75). Within a few decades, English reformist drama would turn the fallen woman into a complicated icon of all that needed reform in traditional, medieval religious practice, especially the use and veneration of images and other material realizations of devotional expression. Badir (<hi rend="italic">Maudlin Impression</hi>, p. 40) says that Wager turns Mary into a decorated idol; Atkin (<hi rend="italic">Drama of Reform</hi>, p. 106) finds her standing in for all religious imagery that the reformed church would replace with the Word of God.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="139">571, s.d.<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Her shal Mary lye doun and slepe </hi><hi rend="italic">in the erbyre</hi>. According to F (pp. 93–98), the arbor scene is part of a major romance “meme” in the play, the motif of “the sleeper in the garden.” In this framework, the arbor or garden is a liminal space where “life-changing intervention from a realm beyond the everyday world” can occur (p. 94). F surveys appearances of and variations on this important motif in a wide range of Middle English romances.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="140">572<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Symont Leprus</hi> (speech heading). The playwright seems to have confused Simon the Pharisee of Luke 7:36–50, with Simon the Leper in Matthew 26:6–16 and Mark 14:3–11. In all three passages Jesus is anointed by an unnamed woman, but only in the home of Simon the Pharisee does Jesus relate the parable of the two debtors, as he also does in the Digby play. Jesus’ parable of the two debtors does not appear in Jacobus’ life of Mary Magdalene.</note>

Simon’s concern for proper provisions for his dinner guests is consistent with other instances in the play that highlight the household and its management, perhaps addressing the values of the play’s target audience and/or its producers.

In characterizing Jesus as the “prophet” of perfection, Simon invokes the ideal that will become the goal of Mary Magdalene’s spiritual life. Devotional works such as Walter Hilton’s <hi rend="italic">Scale</hi><hi rend="italic"> of Perfection</hi> promoted these ideals for religious and sometimes lay contemplatives. As <hi rend="italic">MDS</hi> (pp. 100–101) elaborates, Hilton singles out Mary Magdalene for her achievement of contemplative perfection.</note>

The simultaneity of these different actions, Simon entering the playing place to welcome Jesus in the next scene and Mary’s imminent conversion, furnish a clear instance of dramatic possibilities afforded by the play’s <hi rend="italic">platea</hi> and <hi rend="italic">loca</hi> staging. Like the evil allegorical beings who tempt Mary and the “spiritus malyngny” (line 428), the Good Angel is the playwright’s invention.

Mary Magdalene’s metaphor for the mercy she seeks from prophet Jesus is a fitting counterpoint to the “swete bawmys” (line 613) with which she will anoint him in Simon’s house and also seek out his dead body in his tomb. The conflation of several anointing women in scripture, including the unnamed one who approaches Jesus in the home of Simon the Pharisee, and the Mary Magdalene who bears witness to the resurrection in all four gospels, enabled Gregory the Great’s creation of the composite Magdalene, thereby joining the anointer to the sinner. The anointing scene of Luke 7 provides the core of Gregory’s influential Homily 33; see Gregory the Great, <hi rend="italic">Forty Gospel Homilies</hi>, pp. 268–79. Dugan (<hi rend="italic">Ephemeral</hi><hi rend="italic"> History of Perfume</hi>, p. 39) calls Mary Magdalene’s exchange of her arbor’s precious balms (line 569) for the sweet balms of anointing an instance of <hi rend="italic">contrapasso</hi>, “a structure of penitence demanding that any absolution match the nature of the sin.” Dugan also introduces the notion that the play’s staging itself may have employed its various scents.</note>

Mary Magdalene’s words upon receiving Jesus’ forgiveness constellate important themes and metaphors elaborately developed elsewhere in the play. After addressing Jesus as “lord of evyrlastyng lyfe,” she immediately invokes his birth from his mother Mary, “that puer vergynne” who, though she makes no appearance in the play, nonetheless figures in it as an abiding reference point for Mary Magdalene. See <hi rend="italic">MDS</hi>, pp. 151–54. As Coletti (“Design of the Digby Play”) points out, the newly converted woman employs metaphors of nourishment (“repast contemplatyf”) to describe Jesus’ effect upon her and represents her own transformation through a trope of clothing, as she resolves to “enabyte” herself with humility. The trope of “enhabiting,” as <hi rend="italic">MDS</hi> (p. 263n28) notes, recalls the Pauline concept of ‘putting on’ the new man in Christ (Ephesians 4:23–24; Galatians 3:27–28; Romans 13:12–14; Colossians 3:9–10). It is tempting to speculate how these metaphoric changes of array might have been materially realized on stage. In Wager’s <hi rend="italic">Life and </hi><hi rend="italic">Repentance</hi> (White, <hi rend="italic">Reformation Biblical Drama</hi>, p. 55, line 1765, s.d.), Mary Magdalene marks her conversion with a literal change of clothing.</note>

This remarkable stage direction points up the Digby play’s fondness for vivid dramatic spectacle. The second part of the direction, complete with sound effects, demonstrates the playwright’s inventive depiction of Mary Magdalene’s life of sin, which the play develops in an elaborate allegory. The “dyllys” here are the Seven Deadly Sins. The first portion of the stage direction, though, draws upon the composite Magdalene’s biblical identity, specifically the Gregorian construction that conflated the woman named Magdalene, from whom Jesus cast seven devils (Mark 16:9; Luke 8:2) with the sinful woman of Luke 7. Tamburr (<hi rend="italic">Harrowing of Hell</hi>, p. 146) notes echoes here of the Harrowing of Hell, wherein Christ’s conquering of the devil within the soul of the individual believer parallels that greater redemptive action. Christ was, according to Tamburr, channeling Justin Martyr, the great exorcist. The exorcism of Mary Magdalene’s deadly sins or demons is one of three such scenes in East Anglian drama. In <hi rend="italic">Wisdom</hi> (<hi rend="italic">MP</hi>, pp. 143–46, lines 901–80), Anima emerges as a Magdalene figure by virtue of this and other similarities. As <hi rend="italic">MDS</hi> notes (p. 98), <hi rend="italic">Wisdom</hi> “reads and plays like an allegorical dress rehearsal for the more elaborate . . . treatment of related themes in the Digby <hi rend="italic">Magdalene</hi>.” Sixteenth-century marginalia in the Macro manuscript (<hi rend="italic">MP</hi>, p. xxix) include a ballad that mentions Mary Magdalene, Mary of Egypt, and the Virgin Mary. N-Town’s “Last Supper” conflates Mary Magdalene’s scriptural exorcism in the gospels of Luke and Mark with the anointing episode from Luke 7, and relocates this conflation to the scene of the Last Supper. See <hi rend="italic">NT</hi>, 1:269–71, lines 141–92; and for discussion of these episodes see <hi rend="italic">MDS</hi>, pp. 84–94.</note>

Wanhope, or despair (Latin <hi rend="italic">tristitia</hi>), was a subject of extensive commentary on the part of the Church fathers and later medieval exegetes. Discussions focused on whether despair was itself a “deadly” sin and, if not, what its relationship to sin must be. In the later Middle Ages despair was considered a subset of the sin of sloth (Latin <hi rend="italic">acedia</hi>). Wenzel (<hi rend="italic">Sin of Sloth</hi>, pp. 68–96) provides a basic account.

 <note type="enote" n="173">697<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">the techeyng of </hi><hi rend="italic">Isaye in scryptur</hi>. Revealing a precocious knowledge of the Old Testament, Mary Magdalene proclaims her trust in Isaiah’s prophecies of the coming savior. Possible allusions here include Isaias 9:6–7, which announces the birth of the child who will sit on David’s throne and whose “name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, God the Mighty, the Father of the world to come, the Prince of Peace.” The mention of the names to be ascribed to the deity (“et vocabitur nomen eius”) resonate with the play’s sustained interest in the name of Jesus. See the <ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal">note to lines 93–94</ref> above. Mary Magdalene may also have in mind here Isaias 11:1–2, which speaks of the flower and rod that will rise from the root of Jesse and upon whom the spirit of the Lord will rest.</note>

Citing the unusual placement of this scriptural citation, <hi rend="italic">MDS</hi> (pp. 192–93) suggests that its admonition regarding the relationship of sight to belief applies to both the Magdalene’s outrageous corporeal testimony of faith and the material resources of theater.</note>

Lewis, p. 132, BMH identify the speech as “a tripartite hymn to the Holy Trinity” that treats “each person of the Trinity in succession” (p. 206). Coming immediately after Jesus’ exit from the stage, the Good Angel’s metaphorically rich and conceptually challenging speech, or hymn, directs attention to the Digby play’s representation of the deity, and more specifically, to its Christology. In sharp contrast to important strands of medieval piety that emphasized Christ’s human nature, the Good Angel focuses on exceptional attributes that foreground his “devynyté” and “soverreyn sapyens.” The Good Angel even implies that Jesus’ humanity, his “blessyd mortalyté,” has “obscuryd” his divine nature. As <hi rend="italic">MDS</hi> explains (pp. 114–17), this characterization recalls the Christology that Walter Hilton, in the <hi rend="italic">Scale of Perfection</hi>, propounds in relation to a program of contemplation.</note>

Keyser (“Examining the Body Poetic,” pp. 145–58) discusses the deaths of Lazarus and Cyrus in light of medieval medical knowledge. The Digby play’s interest in physical illness, considered alongside its awareness of medicinal herbs and its use of metaphors of health and healing in spiritual as well as material contexts, may suggest that at some point its auspices were connected to the culture of the medieval hospital.

Carruthers (“Sweetness,” p. 1001) states that medieval “‘sweetness’ — <hi rend="italic">dulcedo</hi>, <hi rend="italic">suavitas</hi> — is among the most mixed and trickiest of concepts”; but Mary and Martha’s intended meaning here seems unambiguous. In light of the play’s representation of Mary Magdalene as a mystic and contemplative (see <hi rend="italic">MDS</hi>, pp. 100–50), Richard Rolle’s account (in <hi rend="italic">Fire of Love</hi>) of the contemplative’s experience of spiritual love as <hi rend="italic">calor</hi>, <hi rend="italic">dulcor</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">canor</hi> (heat, sweetness, and song) also resonates with the sisters’ devout testimony.</note>

The idea of the loving relationship between Jesus and Lazarus originates in the Gospel of John 11:3, where Mary and Martha seek Jesus’ help for their brother, “whom [he] loves” (“quem amas”). But the playwright’s term here (and at lines 798 and 800) to represent Lazarus’ relationship to Jesus is also a familiar trope of medieval devotional and mystical writing, used to describe the devout individual’s relationship to the deity in his humanity. Julian of Norwich’s <hi rend="italic">A Vision Showed to</hi><hi rend="italic"> a Devout Woman</hi> famously begins: “Methought I wolde have bene that time with Mary Maudeleyne and with othere that were Cristes loverse”; <hi rend="italic">Writings of Julian</hi>, ed.

 <note type="enote" n="210">805<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Jherusallem hevenly</hi>. To gloss this difficult passage, BMH (p. 207) cite 1 Corinthians 2:9, where Paul speaks of the inability of human knowledge to access God’s sacred mysteries and wisdom.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="211">802–10<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Of all infyrmyté . . . in heven gloryfyed</hi>. The opening of Jesus’ speech is inspired by John 11:4. Jesus “said to them: ‘This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God’” (<hi rend="italic">Infirmitas haec non est ad mortem, sed pro</hi><hi rend="italic"> gloria Dei</hi>). The Digby playwright, however, departs from the biblical prompt to have Jesus proclaim the inscrutability of both death and the eternal joys of heaven, which can be understood neither by reason nor academic knowledge (“counnyng of clerke”); or such at least is the point that the speech develops, despite the difficulties of line 802, which might also be the result of scribal confusion. <hi rend="italic">MDS</hi> (pp. 121–24) discusses the play’s critique of clerical learning and its portrayal of sacred cognition. Cockett (“Actor’s Carnal Eye,” p. 71) cites this passage as one of three addressing the limitation of words to express spiritual matters (the others occur at lines 1100–03 and 1364–65). The play’s interest in affective and somatic forms of religious knowledge, he contends, not only comports with practices of late medieval affective pieties (as exemplified by East Anglian women mystics Julian of Norwich and Margery Kempe), but also anticipates the work of the actor who might “operate as a medium for sacred truth.”</note>

The weepers gathered by Mary Magdalene are the late medieval stand-ins for the consoling Jews of John 11:19 and 31; Mary’s consciousness of how the act of mourning “must be donne” links the burial of Lazarus not only to Jewish and Middle Eastern funeral customs but also to those of late medieval England. Mourners “clad in blake” frequently appeared in late medieval funerals, especially those of the well-to-do (see also the stage direction after line 841).The 1519 will of Anne Sulyard of Suffolk provided for 24 poor men and women “to be clad in Blak with hoodes of the same.” Such mourners were often recipients of the deceased person’s charity.

Because the risen Lazarus of John’s gospel does not speak, medieval writers who wanted to represent this episode had enormous leeway in devising words for the man newly returned from death. The Digby play’s Lazarus perhaps alludes to a comment that John gives to Martha (11:39) when he refers to the rot that should have consumed his flesh and bones. Lazarus figures in medieval English drama display a range of responses to the miraculous testimony to Jesus’ divinity that they represent.

This stage direction invokes a social identity (“chast women”) and a visual image (“sygnis of the passon”) extremely important in late medieval religious culture. The introduction of the three Marys as chaste women aligns them with the social role of the vowess, a lay woman who formally professed before ecclesiastical authority her intention to pursue a chaste life in world. The stage direction’s notice of the women’s array further signals the vowess’ symbolic apparel. See <hi rend="italic">MDS</hi>, pp. 50–53. The symbols of the Passion “pryntyd” on this attire allude either to the <hi rend="italic">arma Christi</hi>, a cluster of images representing the instruments of the Passion, or to a more focused image, sometimes called ‘arms of the Passion,’ that showed Christ’s wounds depicted against the background of the cross.

Jesus’ scriptural admonition to Mary Magdalene (John 20:17) has a long and productive presence in medieval English drama.

The first exchange between the pagan priest and his clerk, named Hawkyn, is potentially confusing. The priest commands the clerk to prepare his altar for the sacrifice that the king of Marseilles has just proposed; Hawkyn responds with a <hi rend="italic">non sequitur</hi>, alluding to the priest’s illicit sexual relationships with women. Despite the priest’s denials, the clerk’s allusions turn preparations for the pagan rite into a competitive, salacious moment. The scene anticipates a similar conflict between the shipmaster and his boy later in the play. Weimann (<hi rend="italic">Shakespeare and the Popular Tradition</hi>, pp. 138–42) associates the priest’s boy with the Garcio type, named for the unruly servant in the Towneley “Mactacio Abel” play, whose role it is to challenge the master, employing verbal inversion and word play to unsettle the master’s rule. Weimann identifies other Garcio figures in the Towneley and Chester Shepherds’ plays, and the Towneley “Coliphizacio,” or Play of the Buffeting. The Digby priest and boy are also reminiscent of the master-servant rivalry between the quack doctor Brundyche and his boy Colle in the <hi rend="italic">Croxton Play of the</hi><hi rend="italic"> Sacrament</hi> (lines 525–96). In this and subsequent comedic episodes at lines 1395–1422 and 1716–44, F (p. 124) suggests a resemblance to fabliaux and ventures a comparison to the interludes of masters and servants in the plays of Terence.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="289">1151<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Sentt Coppyn</hi>. The priest swears by an imaginary saint. BMH (p. 210) suggest several possibilities for the name’s significance; for example, St. James/Jacob, with Cobbin as a diminutive, and a Jew named Copin, hanged for the murder of St. Hugh of Lincoln. The name also appears in “The Buffeting of Christ” in <hi rend="italic">Towneley</hi>, where “King Copyn” seems to mean “impostor” (1:258, line 241).

The clerk’s garbled, incomprehensible lesson employs dog-Latin, identified by the adding of the genitive plural (–<hi rend="italic">orum</hi>) to a series of nouns. Scherb (“Blasphemy and the Grotesque,” p. 236) notes that the mock <hi rend="italic">lectio</hi> “consists of a series of gnomic utterances rather than a linear argument or narrative”; its “phrases fail to form coherent sentences, but they do invoke motifs that . . . associate the pagan temple with blasphemy and grotesque.” According to Scherb, these motifs focus on food and bodily consumption (“Gormoerdorum alocorum” and “fartum cardiculorum”); sex (“Castratum”); and the “perversion or inversion of ideal Christian religious values.” BMH (p. 211) state that the mock reading’s “Snyguer snagoer werwolfforum / Standgardum lamba beffettorum” is a “common figure for the careless priest.” The playwright here seems also to be taking delight in the comic possibilities of sound: “Snyguer snagoer” and “Rygour dagour.” Brokaw (<hi rend="italic">Staging Harmony</hi>, p. 34) suggests a musical dimension, noting the “mock plainsong” of the boy’s chant. Such play with ecclesiastical and liturgical Latin idioms occurs elsewhere in medieval English drama. See Rastall, “Sounds of Hell,” pp. 106–08, 123; The Play of the Dice or “Processus Talorum” in <hi rend="italic">Towneley</hi>, 1:309–10, lines 1–46. As Goldie (“Audiences for Language-Play,” pp. 199–202) demonstrates, linguistic play with differences between Latin and English was a regular feature of medieval English drama. He notes its appearance in the Macro plays <hi rend="italic">Mankind</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Wisdom</hi> as well as biblical dramas. Goldie locates this dramatic language play in larger contexts of audience reception, using evidence from medieval grammatical and preaching texts to suggest possible horizons of audience expectation and complex possibilities for the apprehension of linguistic play.</note>

 <note type="enote" n="311">1232–37<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">For </hi><hi rend="italic">here may . . . Mahowndys own yeelyd</hi>. Like the Pardoner in Chaucer’s <hi rend="italic">Canterbury Tales</hi>, the priest invites (line 1236) his audience to “kisse the relikes” (<hi rend="italic">CT</hi> VI[C] 944). The priest’s appeal invokes the medieval cult of relics, which ascribed spiritual power to fragments of the physical remains of holy people, i.e. Christ and his saints, as well material objects associated with them. Extending the play’s representation of a conflated Muslin/pagan religion in terms of the practices of late medieval Christianity, the priest touts the benefit of contact with Mahound’s “nekke bon” and “yeelyd,” just as the Pardoner impresses upon the Canterbury pilgrims the virtues of the Virgin Mary’s veil and Saint Peter’s sail (<hi rend="italic">CT</hi> I[A] 694–97). But the Digby priest also undercuts his promise by inverting the usual benefit believed to follow from contact with holy relics; his relics will make their devotees “blynd forevyr more” (line 1240). Akbari (<hi rend="italic">Idols in the</hi><hi rend="italic"> East</hi>, pp. 217–20) aligns the Digby play with other late medieval representations of Islam that make relics central to Muslim worship, comparing the king of Marseilles to Muslim rulers in the <hi rend="italic">Sowdone of Babylone</hi> and other ME romances. Unlike literary versions in which the disavowal of a caricatured Muslim worship results in the convert’s destruction of the idols, the Digby play makes the demise of the “maments” (lines 1553, s.d.; 1561, s.d.) the direct result of Mary Magdalene’s prayer (lines 1552–61).

This reading comports with the priest’s inclusion of “Golyas” (line 1244) in his prayer, probably signifying Goliath, the Philistine giant killed by David in 1 Samuel 17. Both names contribute to the exoticism of the pagan religion of Marseilles. The collocation of Mahownd, Dragon, and Golyas may reflect a tendency in medieval representations of Islam (Akbari, <hi rend="italic">Idols in</hi><hi rend="italic"> the East</hi>, p. 203) to make proponents of the religion worshipers of a three-fold pantheon of false gods, usually Muhammad, Apollo, and Tervagant.</note>

Self-identifying earlier in the play as “juge of Jherusalem” (line 231), Pilate expresses misgivings about the legal proceedings that led to Jesus’ death.

See A. Williams, <hi rend="italic">Characterization</hi><hi rend="italic"> of Pilate</hi>.

The Provost’s notice of the “froward fode” fed to those who stole Christ’s dead body, with its “corupcyon” (line 1325), would then indicate the unfortunate circumstance of their having to make off with a smelly corpse.

The appearance of Jesus in heaven, from which he praises his mother and commands Mary Magdalene to “converte the land of Marcyll” (line 1371), has no precedent in textual and iconographic traditions of the medieval Magdalene. The scene underscores the complexity of the play’s staging, including its dependence on multi-level <hi rend="italic">loci</hi> that provided for up and down movement. This disposition is essential for the activity of the angels from this moment to the end of the play, as well as for Mary Magdalene’s own ascent into the heavens. Davis (“As Above, So Below”) constructs a stage plan for the play based in part on its requirement for elevated playing stations. Davidson (<hi rend="italic">Technology</hi>, pp. 81–100, 119–22) discusses the ingenuity and technological know-how that enabled such dramatic raising and lowerings, for example at line 1375, s.d.: <hi rend="italic">Tunc decendet angelus</hi>.

Jesus shifts metaphoric registers in order to praise the Virgin Mary’s identification with medicinal plans and herbs. Unable to describe Mary’s virtue in language (lines 1364–65), Jesus “describes her instead through an epistemology of scent” that displaces, according to Dugan (<hi rend="italic">Ephemeral History of Perfume</hi>, p. 40), the King of Flesh’s “worldly amalgamation of ambergris, galingale, and clary with powerful musk, precious incense, cinnamon, and English gillyflower.” As Keyser (“Examining the Body Poetic,” pp. 161–218) shows, John Lydgate’s <hi rend="italic">Life</hi><hi rend="italic"> of Our Lady</hi> similarly explores the Virgin as an agent of health and healing.</note>

Containing some of the play’s most densely metaphoric language, Jesus’ encomium to the Virgin Mary is a compendium of familiar and unusual Marian tropes, drawing upon both scriptural exegesis and medical horticulture. The temple of Solomon (3 Kings 10:18–20) and fleece of Gideon (Judges 6:36–40) are common Marian figures, as are images of her illuminating capacities, represented here by the “paleys of Phebus bryghtnesse.” Noting this passage’s dependence on ME Marian lyrics and liturgy, F (p. 60) comments on Mary’s association with heavenly bodies and light. The paratactic structure of this passage accumulates metaphoric attributes of the Virgin without providing an overarching narrative or statement. The speech extends the play’s Christological interests by underscoring the Virgin Mary’s crucial role in the production of Jesus’ manhood, and therefore, his godhead, as <hi rend="italic">MDS</hi> (pp. 163–68) explains. Bennett (“Meaning of the Digby”) notes the Marian allusions in these and other scenes. Scherb (<hi rend="italic">Staging Faith</hi>, p. 200) suggests that Jesus may be addressing an actual representation of the Virgin Mary located somewhere in the playing space.</note>

Most lives of the saint follow <hi rend="italic">LA</hi>’s master narrative, which provided for Mary Magdalene to leave the Holy Land, with companions Lazarus, Martha, and Maximin, on a rudderless ship. According to F (pp. 104–11), this crucial departure from the traditional <hi rend="italic">vita</hi> makes Mary Magdalene’s dramatic story into an instance of another medieval romance meme, that of the “woman cast adrift.” F surveys illustrations of this important motif in Chaucer, Gower, and ME romance.

In the later Middle Ages, this tradition was invoked to authorize women’s sacred speech and their role as teachers and preachers.

Pierre Gringore’s illustrations for pageants designed to welcome Mary Tudor to Paris in 1514, in BL MS Cotton Vespasian B.II, include one for a fully-rigged ship, complete with sailors in a festive mood. See Baskerville, <hi rend="italic">Pierre Gringore’s Pageants</hi>. The Digby play’s association of the shipmen with merriment may pick up on the appearance of ship pageants in public entertainments (Baskerville, p. xxi).

The saint invokes the gospel of John 1:1 and responds to the king’s question with an account of the creation that follows Genesis 1, which also begins “<hi rend="italic">in principio</hi>.” This specificity marks a major departure from the play’s major source in Jacobus’ <hi rend="italic">LA</hi>, which thus describes Mary Magdalene’s preaching in Marseilles (<hi rend="italic">GL</hi>, p. 123): “And when the blessyd Marie Magdalene sawe the peple assembled at this temple for to doo sacrefyse to th[e] ydollis, she aroos up peasibly with a glad visage, a dyscrete tongue and wel spekyng, and began to preche the faythe &amp; lawe of Ihesu Cryst.” Among all the medieval English <hi rend="italic">vitae</hi> of the saint, the Digby playwright uniquely identifies Mary Magdalene as a public preacher of vernacular scripture.

The king’s attempt to demonstrate the power of his false gods or idols and all the trappings of the vaguely pagan religion that the play associates with Mahound ironically anticipate English reformers’ identification of Mary Magdalene with the very material and imaginative excess of religious expression that they sought to suppress. Badir (<hi rend="italic">Maudlin Impression</hi>, pp. 36–41) states that Wager’s <hi rend="italic">Life and Repentaunce</hi> makes the fallen Magdalene into a decorated idol who in effect represents the unreformed church.

Mary Magdalene’s prayer offers the most elaborate instance of devotion to the Name of Jesus expressed in the play. As Renevey (“Name above Names”) points out, worship of the holy Name was an important theme in late medieval English mystical and spiritual writings and was widely promoted by Richard Rolle and Walter Hilton. Devotion to the Name of Jesus is attested elsewhere in late medieval East Anglia. John Lydgate makes it a notable theme of “The Testament”; see <hi rend="italic">Minor</hi><hi rend="italic"> Poems</hi>, ed. MacCracken, 1:329–62. Gibson (<hi rend="italic">Theater of Devotion</hi>, pp. 49, 187–88n91) notes that fifteenth-century Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, was home to a large and popular lay confraternity dedicated to “The Holy Name of Jesus.” The <hi rend="italic">Croxton Play of the</hi><hi rend="italic"> Sacrament</hi>, widely associated with Bury, concludes with a blessing offered “in wyrshyppe of thys name gloryows” (lines 1004–07).

Mary Magdalene’s appeal to the king for sustenance resonates with medieval discourses that addressed the necessity of charity toward the poor. Anticipating the saint’s preaching about poverty at lines 1923–30, her interaction with the king here calls attention to her own involuntary poverty (when she later retreats to the wilderness, she will exercise voluntary poverty). Both of these were recognized in the complex social practices and discourses that accompanied medieval understandings of poverty and charity. For example, Mary’s mention of “hongor, threst, and cold” specifies the three basic ‘needs’ identified in those discourses, just as the king’s promise of “mete and mony, and clothys for the nyth” (line 1652) offers charity to assuage them. As Coletti argues (<hi rend="italic">PDD</hi>, pp. 358–68), the Digby play represents Mary Magdalene’s entire life, and especially her encounters in Marseilles, as an elaborate staging of these discourses’ central terms and principles.</note>

The queen’s apostrophe initiates the play’s association of Mary Magdalene with divine attributes and links the queen’s profession of faith with her new-found fecundity.

The queen’s address to her husband associates their relationship with the hierarchical structures of late medieval royal families.

The king’s consent to the queen’s request to accompany him marks the beginning of their story’s resemblance to that of Pericles, most notably in Shakespeare’s version.

 <note type="enote" n="414">1734–35<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Thou hast stollyn . . . owt </hi><hi rend="italic">of lond</hi>. The shipmaster’s allegations of impropriety, signaled by the king’s haste to depart, add another dimension to the play’s attention to illicit and transgressive sexualities. Offering Chaucer’s Shipman’s Tale as an example, F (p. 152) cites “the discourse about sex, money, and exchange that often circulates through tales of merchants and mercantile exchange.”</note>
 <note type="enote" n="415">1739<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Ten marke I wyll thee gyff</hi>. The king’s financial negotiation with the shipmaster recalls Mary Magdalene’s similar awareness of the cost of the sea journey (lines 1431–32). The <hi rend="italic">MED</hi> identifies the <hi rend="italic">marke</hi> (n.2), sense 2a as a “monetary unit equivalent to 160 pennies or 2/3 of a pound sterling.” Morrison (<hi rend="italic">Women Pilgrims</hi>, p. 54) notes that medieval shipmasters could improve upon a voyage’s profitability by transporting pilgrims. F (pp. 148–52) also discusses the play’s portrayal of the mariner and his crew and its relation to late medieval seafaring practices.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="416">1747<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">flower of wommanned</hi>. The queen’s apostrophe, presumably to Mary Magdalene, as the “flower of womanhood” introduces an epithet more commonly applied to the Virgin Mary and signals the confusion between and identification of the reformed saint and the mother of Jesus that, as <hi rend="italic">MDS</hi> notes (pp. 169–79, 185–89) figures prominently in the latter portions of the play. T. Williams’ discussion of evolving gendered terminology in late medieval English writing observes that “womanhood” here signals the exercise of feminine power (<hi rend="italic">Inventing Womanhood</hi>, p. 151).</note>

At some point in these lines the queen gives birth, her distress causing her to appeal to “Mary, Mary.” She laments the “defawte of wommen” (line 1762), i.e. midwives, who might have assisted in the birth that now brings about her death. Guillaume le Clerc’s Anglo-Norman life of the saint (“Romance of Mary Magdalene,” p. 192) depicts the queen’s plight, and that of childbearing women generally with heightened emotional detail. The misfortune of the woman who endures an ordinary human birth without “wommannys help” (line 1759) recalls the very different situation of the Virgin Mary, who effortlessly gives birth to the baby Jesus with no midwives in attendance and retains her radiant virginity in the process.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="419">1776<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">What wethyr may this be</hi>. Apart from the queen’s mention of the “flod” in which she hopes not to “drench” (line 1746), this is the play’s main notice of the storm at sea, described in greater length in <hi rend="italic">GL</hi> (p. 127) and with notable meteorological detail in Guillaume le Clerc’s Anglo-Norman life of the saint; see “Romance of Mary Magdalene,” pp. 191–93.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="420">1783<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Gyntyll serys</hi>. The king sweetens his request to the mariner and his men by applying to them an attribute — gentility — that would seem not to pertain to persons of their social class. On the play’s attention to the idiom of social class, see C; and for its application to the shipmaster and crew particularly, see <hi rend="italic">PDD</hi>, pp. 353–57).

BMH (p. 215) confirm Jaffa, the port city adjacent to Tel Aviv in ancient Palestine, as the correct referent. Whereas Mary Magdalene in <hi rend="italic">GL</hi> tells the king that Peter resides in Rome, the Digby saint gives no indication of his whereabouts when she tells the king to seek him. The Digby playwright may have had the mariner call out “the portt Jaf” because Jaffa is the site of important miracles enacted by Peter in Acts 9:36–42 and 10:5–23.</note>

Peter insists that the king seek true “experyens” through his own direct “inspeccyon” of holy places. In late medieval religious and epistemological discourses, the term “experience” connotes knowledge acquired through sense perceptions, attributes, and behaviors of the perceiving subject in contrast to knowledge obtained from official culture as codified in written texts and institutional discourses. When Peter directs the king to seek “very experyens,” he invokes an emergent value in late medieval spirituality that emphasized private, affective experiences as legitimate modes of knowing apart from traditional conceptions of authority. Increasing attention to knowledge acquired in this manner coincides with developments in lay, vernacular religious culture.

 <note type="enote" n="476"><space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Asumpta est Maria in nubibus</hi>. As M (p. 273) notes, the stage direction signals the singing of the Lauds antiphon for the liturgical celebration of the Virgin Mary’s Assumption; the hymn further reinforces the identification of Mary Magdalene with the mother of Jesus that appears elsewhere in the play.

Casting Mary Magdalene in the role of Christ’s beloved, the priest’s first address to her invokes the scriptural commonplace of the heavenly Jerusalem. Walter Hilton makes Jerusalem the goal of the contemplative’s spiritual pilgrimage, the perfection or “perfythnesse” that the priest attributes to Mary: “Jerusalem . . . bitokeneth contemplacion in perfighte love of God” (<hi rend="italic">Scale of Perfection</hi>, ed.

 <note type="enote" n="484">2065<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Prest</hi> (speech heading). The unnamed priest stands in for Maximin, companion of Mary Magdalene who, in the saint’s legendary life, travels with her to Marseilles, where he eventually becomes bishop of Aix. As <hi rend="italic">MDS</hi> (pp. 131–33) notes, the Digby play’s omission of Maximin, an important figure in the <hi rend="italic">GL</hi>’s <hi rend="italic">vita</hi>, enables the dramatic Magdalene to exhibit a different relationship to clerical authority and institutions.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="485">2070<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">But tyme is comme that I shall asende</hi>. See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">ascenden</hi> (v.), sense 1a. Mary Magdalene ambiguously speaks of her anticipated death in terms that call to mind the literal, bodily ascension to heaven of Christ and the bodily assumption of his mother. Although the saint’s death finds her enduringly connected to the earth, which she kisses at the moment of her passing (line 2114), the play’s final scenes repeatedly elide her fundamental differences from the Virgin Mary, echoing the relationship between Christ and his mother made familiar through the account of the Virgin Mary’s Assumption in <hi rend="italic">GL</hi>. The N-Town “Assumption of Mary,” based largely on Jacobus’ version of that event, provides a useful lens on these similarities. Like the Digby play, the “Assumption” adapts for the stage a narrative account of female bodily exaltation: the Virgin Mary takes up eternal, bodily residence in heaven beside her son, and Mary Magdalene is raised up by angels to receive daily feedings of manna. In addition to specific verbal resemblances between the two works identified in these explanatory notes, N-Town’s “Assumption” play occasionally departs from <hi rend="italic">GL</hi> in the same ways as does the Digby <hi rend="italic">Magdalene</hi>. For example, both plays show Jesus explaining from on high the special privileges he grants to the Virgin and Mary Magdalene. See <hi rend="italic">NT</hi>, 1:387–409.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="486">2074<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">a crown to</hi><hi rend="italic"> bere</hi>. Jesus’ promise to Mary Magdalene of a crown as her rightful reward looks back to the moment when he called for her to be “inhansyd” above virgins (line 2022). The crown was a material, visible sign of the virgin’s spiritual state. As Hotchin (“Nun’s Crown”) explains, in late medieval monastic practice, the wearing of the crown symbolized the professed virgin’s privileged spiritual status. M (p. 273) suggests a parallel with the coronation of the Virgin Mary.</note>

The palm is an emblem of martyrdom and virginity; for Mary Magdalene it must signify the latter, though she is herself victorious over worldly temptation and material travails. This symbol appears frequently in medieval iconography of the saints. In <hi rend="italic">LA</hi>’s (2:78) account of the Virgin Mary’s Assumption, an angel presents Mary with a “palm branch from paradise,” to be carried before the bier upon her death. N-Town’s “Assumption” play includes a similar line: “A braunce of a palme — owth of paradis com this” (<hi rend="italic">NT</hi>, 1:392, line 134).

Mary Magdalene is peacefully interred in the play, but the site of her burial — and claims to possess her relics — were contested subjects from the thirteenth century, as her established cult at Vézelay in Burgundy gave way to powerful claims advanced by political and religious forces in Provence. See Jansen, “Mary Magdalen.”</note>
 <note type="enote" n="497">2131<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">sentens</hi>. <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">sentence</hi> (n.), sense 5, especially sense c: “a passage of prose or verse in a written work; the text of such a passage.”</note>
 <note type="enote" n="498">2139<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Te</hi><hi rend="italic"> Deum laudamus</hi>. The play provides for the singing of a popular hymn that was put to many different religious and social uses in the Middle Ages, suggesting that the “clerkys” to whom the command to sing is addressed (line 2138) would have no difficulty responding; see Brokaw, <hi rend="italic">Staging Harmony</hi>, pp. 45–47. The <hi rend="italic">Croxton Play of the Sacrament</hi> (line 1007) and the <hi rend="italic">Castle of Perseverance</hi> (line 3649) also conclude with the singing of <hi rend="italic">Te Deum</hi>.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="499">2131–39<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Sufferens</hi><hi rend="italic"> . . . lett us syng</hi>. The text shifts abruptly as it moves from representing the saint’s life to addressing a dramatic audience. The designation of that audience as “sufferens,” or sovereigns, comports with other instances of audience address in East Anglian drama and also suggests frameworks for thinking about the important — and lost — social and institutional contexts for medieval East Anglian dramatic performances. For an inventory of examples across dramatic genres, see <hi rend="italic">MDS</hi>, pp. 244–45n56.The reference in line 2138 to “clerkys” is tantalizing, especially in view of the grand ambitions of the Digby <hi rend="italic">Magdalene</hi> text and the virtually invisible footprint, on the ground, of possible circumstances for the performance of this play.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="500">2139, s.d.<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Explicit oreginale </hi><hi rend="italic">de Sancta Maria Magdalena</hi>. BMH (p. 218) determine the reference to an “oreginale” as evidence that the scribe was “working from an ‘official’ copy, the play-book,” an object that is clearly not the play’s single extant manuscript. In the copious records of the Chester Cycle, the term “Regenall,” or “orygenall,” suggests a master text, like the York register, to which individual guilds regularly had recourse for the copying of their plays. See Clopper, “History and Development,” pp. 241–42.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="501">2140–43<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Yff ony thyng . . . that to amend</hi>. These lines may communicate the interests of the playwright or the scribe; presumably these are not the same person. In light of the obviously dramatic nature of the text whose transcription has just concluded, the reference to “redars” suggests a complex relationship between the performative and readerly dimensions of the Digby <hi rend="italic">Magdalene</hi> as a textual artifact.</note>
