        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>
      </projectDesc>
      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s), textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor, congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p><correction>
          <p>This text may include corrections made after the original edition went to press in order to correct errors and improve glosses. For a full list of editorial and typographical corrections made to this edition, please view its correction log on Github: https://github.com/mets-editions/coletti-digbymagdalene/blob/main/coletti-digbymagdalene-export-corrections-log.docx</p>

 <p style="bodyfirst">I’m happy for the opportunity, at long last, to express my gratitude to the institutions and individuals who have encouraged and underwritten my work. At the beginning of this endeavor, a research grant from the University of Maryland’s College of Arts and Humanities enabled me to consult Bodleian Library MS Digby 133 in Oxford. I am grateful to the staff at the Bodleian who assisted me in my consultation of Digby 133. At this project’s conclusion, and like many METS editors before me, I am pleased to recognize the National Endowment for the Humanities for its long support of this series.</p>
 <p style="body">This project has benefitted from the work of my smart and capable student research assistants at the University of Maryland: Carissa Baker, Christine Maffuccio, Maggie Ray, and Jeffrey Griswold. Gail McMurray Gibson provided astute commentary on portions of the introduction and remains my trusted fellow traveler in all things East Anglian. Emily Steiner’s seminar in medieval performance at the University of Pennsylvania test-drove an early version of the edited text; Genelle Gertz’s students at Washington and Lee University read a later version and welcomed me to talk about it.</p>
 <p style="body">METS staff at the University of Rochester have made major contributions to this project. I’m delighted to thank the cohort of graduate student editors who worked on producing the text of Mary Magdalene for this edition. For their ever meticulous and insightful reading of (too) many versions of this project, assistant METS editors Martha Johnson-Olin and Pamela Yee deserve my deepest thanks, as well as staff editors Leah Haught, Alison Harper, and Ashley Conklin. And it’s my great pleasure to have a new occasion to express my life-long gratitude to METS General Editor and my teacher, mentor, and friend, the incomparable Russell Peck.</p>
